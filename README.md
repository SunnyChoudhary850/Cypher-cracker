# Cypher-cracker
This project is a simple Python-based tool designed to help crack password hashes using a wordlist. It supports popular hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA3-512, SHA384, and SHA224. The tool works by taking a hash input from the user, then comparing it to the hashes of words from a wordlist until it finds a match.
